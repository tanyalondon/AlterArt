#AlterArt Studio
This is a site for an art studio which seeks to foster an understanding of the visual arts and provide a strong aesthetic foundation. At every level, the studio seeks to develop the students’/artists’ talent as visual artists and impart exceptionall skills. It aims to do this by incorporating new technologies into the production and delivery of the visual arts and by increasing the interrelationship of all creative activities in teaching and studio production.The site is useful for artists, from beginner to professional, to get more information on the studio sessions offered.
The website was designed.using mobile first development to allow for the largely mobile user base. 
Features
##Navigation Bar
This feature was inspired by the Love Running project
It is available on all three pages, the responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Works and Info page. 
The user is able to browse fom page to page across all devices without having to return to the previous page.



The ‘hero’ image on the landing page
The landing page has an image of a collage of art studies with text overlay of the location of the studio.
The colourful image was intentionally generated and chosen to have eyes at the centre, on any display size, that appear to gaze at the user and draw them in.

#Works
The Works page is the gallery of artwork created at the studio.
The images of various artworks are presented with a fade in- and-out transition animation. This was largely inspired by this youtube tutorial, with bespoke adjustments to make it work for the images in the gallery, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Luw79S_fMY.
This section is meant to inspire the prospective studio members and artists and stimulate creativity.

The studio could sell art supplies online.
Some videos art tutorials on the website could be an additional add-on feature


#Testing
#Validator Testing
#HTML
Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
#CSS
The fade-in-out animation code is from CSS3 and wasn't recognised i the CSS checker. However, the code is functional and was not changed. 
No other errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
#Unfixed Bugs
The fade-and-out slider works well but can take a few seconds to start, particularly on slow internet connections.  However, to compensate, the slide shown when it is starting up is the last slide, which was intentionally chosen to be a ‘collage’ of works from the studio. This was done so that the visitor can see some representative works while waiting for the slider to start.
